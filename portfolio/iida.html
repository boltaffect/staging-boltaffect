<p><span class="caps">IIDA</span> Carolinas came to us hoping to streamline their judging process for interior project design submissions. In talking
    with them, we discovered that the process was broken into three areas. The process starts with the need for a custom
    form for every entrant. <span class="caps">IIDA</span> needed to be able to administer the competition with a project submission list view.
    The judges needed access to a private gallery that limited the project information.

    &lt;img src="/media/images/portfolio/iida-4.png" alt="Custom Categories"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/media/images/portfolio/iida-6.png" alt="Submission Management by Category"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>The&nbsp;Form</h2>
<p>We started with a custom form that not only captures all the necessary information, including a detailed project description,
but also allows for uploading all the graphic pieces that tell the story of a great design project - floor plans <span class="amp">&amp;</span> comprehensive&nbsp;images.</p>
<h2>Gallery&nbsp;Administration</h2>
<p>The Design Chapter members have access to each entry for reference through a submission list view. They can determine
at a glance entrants, payment status, submissions by project or membership number. We also gave them the ability to view
the form and to download the entire&nbsp;project.</p>

<h2>Submission Dashboard with PayPal&nbsp;Integration</h2>
<p><span class="caps">IIDA</span> already collected payment with PayPal, so we took the existing system that everyone was familiar with and integrated
payment information into the project. Administrators could see who had paid and who had not, right from the submission&nbsp;listings.</p>

<h2>Judging the&nbsp;Competition</h2>
<p>The panel of judges has the ability to login and view only the Gallery of entries. Their permission level prevents any
personal information from appearing, to maintain the necessary environment for&nbsp;judging.</p>
